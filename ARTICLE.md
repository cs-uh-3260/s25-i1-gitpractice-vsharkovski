# Vlad's Article Highlight

The article I am highlighting is called [Collection of insane and fun facts about SQLite](https://avi.im/blag/2024/sqlite-facts/).

This is a really fun article which introduced me to what [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) really is and why it's different from other 'database systems'.
Most database management systems, such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), run on a server (which can be a process on the same machine, or on another machine).
They are usually pretty 'heavy,' as in they take up a decent amount of space to set up and use.
On the other hand, they're extremely optimized and have a ton of features.
SQLite is different and they basically call it 'a replacement for `fopen`.'
Basically, it is extremely light-weight and can be included anywhere as a header-only C library or through another language API.
It doesn't have many features, but it's extremely fast.
They call it a replacement for `fopen` because it is almost as fast and works with SQL.
In other words, you can make a database for your application, and SQLite facilitates this while being light-weight and taking minimal setup.
It seems ideal for small applications.

With this context in mind, I encourage you to read the article. *My favorite facts are 1, 9, 14, and 17.*
